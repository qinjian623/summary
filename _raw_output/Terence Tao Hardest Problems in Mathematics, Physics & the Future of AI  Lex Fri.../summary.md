**Summary:**

The podcast features a conversation with Terence Tao, one of the greatest mathematicians of all time, known for his groundbreaking work in mathematics and physics. Tao won the Fields Medal and the Breakthrough Prize, and his contributions span numerous fields. Here, Tao shares insights about some of the hardest problems in mathematics and physics, including the KKF problem, Navier-Stokes equations, and the role of artificial intelligence in mathematical research.

Tao reflects on the nature of mathematical research, specifically the boundary between solvable and unsolvable problems. For instance, in his early research, the KKF problem, related to a puzzle from 1918, intrigued him and was eventually solved after much work. He explains that understanding the problem's geometric and physical implications, such as how rotating an object in two or three dimensions minimizes space, led to a deeper connection between geometry, physics, and partial differential equations. The solutions often involve deeper understanding of wave propagation and singularities, which is crucial for fields like fluid dynamics and physics.

A significant portion of the conversation revolves around the famous *Navier-Stokes equation*—a long-standing challenge in fluid dynamics that governs the behavior of incompressible fluids. Tao delves into the complexities of this problem, discussing his work in 2016 related to finite-time blow-ups, which are critical for understanding turbulence and chaos in fluids. He also touches on his work related to supercritical equations, where nonlinearity dominates and creates unpredictable behaviors.

The podcast also explores the broader connection between mathematics and physics. Tao discusses how mathematical modeling often pushes the boundaries of intuition, and how artificial intelligence might assist in the formalization of mathematical proofs. He discusses *Lean*, a proof assistant programming language, and how it is transforming the way mathematicians collaborate and formalize proofs. This also brings up the philosophical aspects of mathematics, with Tao exploring the tension between the idealized models mathematicians work with and the actual physical reality these models try to represent.

Overall, Tao's reflections illuminate the immense challenges and beauty of mathematics, and how AI tools are shaping the future of mathematical research. His approach to solving difficult problems blends creativity, collaboration, and the power of formalized mathematics.

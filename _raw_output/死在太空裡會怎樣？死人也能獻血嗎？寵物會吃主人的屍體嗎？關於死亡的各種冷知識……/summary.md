**Summary of Podcast: "死在太空裡會怎樣？死人也能獻血嗎？寵物會吃主人的屍體嗎？關於死亡的各種冷知識"**

In this podcast episode, the host explores various intriguing and somewhat eerie questions related to death, ranging from what happens to a body in space to whether pets will eat their deceased owners' remains. Here are the main points:

1. **Death in Space:**
   - If an astronaut dies in space, their body would be exposed to the vacuum of space, leading to rapid expansion of bodily fluids. However, their body wouldn’t explode like in sci-fi; instead, it would become swollen due to the lack of pressure. The body would eventually dry out and become mummified due to the vacuum. If exposed to extreme cold (e.g., in the shadow of space), the body could freeze like a preserved specimen. However, in close proximity to a star, the body would burn or even vaporize due to extreme heat.

2. **Pets Eating Deceased Owners:**
   - Cats and dogs may eventually eat parts of their deceased owners' bodies. Cats tend to start with softer, exposed areas like the eyes, while dogs may nibble at the body out of anxiety and stress before resorting to more destructive behavior if left without food for an extended period.

3. **Can the Dead Donate Blood?**
   - Yes, blood from the deceased can be used for transfusions, but only if extracted within six hours of death. Experiments in the past have shown that blood from a recently deceased person can still be viable for transfusion purposes, though this practice is not widely accepted.

4. **Post-Death Use of Sperm:**
   - It's possible for sperm to remain viable for several days after death, and there have been successful cases where sperm was extracted from deceased men and used for artificial insemination. This is often done for legal and emotional reasons, particularly in cases where people want to preserve their genetic legacy.

5. **Cryonics and Plastination:**
   - Some individuals opt for cryonics, where their bodies are frozen in the hope of future revival, though the technology for reviving a frozen human body is not yet advanced. Alternatively, plastination allows for the preservation of bodies by replacing fluids and fats with synthetic materials, creating long-lasting, lifelike specimens for educational or artistic purposes.

**播客摘要： "死在太空裡會怎樣？死人也能獻血嗎？寵物會吃主人的屍體嗎？關於死亡的各種冷知識"**

在这期播客中，主持人探讨了与死亡相关的各种有趣和略显阴森的问题，包括死在太空里后的情况、宠物是否会吃掉主人尸体以及死后是否可以献血等。以下是主要内容：

1. **太空中的死亡：**
   - 如果宇航员死在太空中，他们的尸体会暴露在真空中，导致体内液体迅速膨胀。然而，身体不会像科幻小说中描述的那样爆炸，而是会因为缺乏压力而肿胀。最终，尸体会由于真空而干枯，成为木乃伊。如果尸体暴露在极寒（例如太空阴影区域），可能会像冰雕一样被冷冻保存。但如果靠近恒星，尸体会因高温而被烧毁或气化。

2. **宠物吃掉死去主人的尸体：**
   - 猫和狗可能最终会吃掉死去主人的身体。猫通常从柔软、暴露的部位开始吃，比如眼睛；而狗则可能因为焦虑和压力，先尝试吮吸死主人的嘴唇，接着会吃掉身体的其他部位，尤其在长期没有食物时。

3. **死人可以献血吗？**
   - 死后6小时内提取的血液是可以用于输血的。过去的实验显示，死者的血液在短时间内仍然是有效的，尽管这一做法并不被广泛接受。

4. **死后取精：**
   - 死后男性的精子在数天内仍然可以保持活性，已有成功案例在死后提取精液并进行人工受精。某些人通过这种方式保留遗传基因。

5. **冷冻人类和塑化技术：**
   - 有些人选择冷冻保存自己的尸体，希望将来科技发展能够复活。另一种选择是人体塑化技术，通过替换体内的液体和脂肪来永久保存尸体。这项技术广泛应用于解剖学展示和艺术展览。

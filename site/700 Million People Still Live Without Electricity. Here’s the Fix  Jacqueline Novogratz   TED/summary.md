**Summary of the Plan to Solve the Electricity Access Problem**

This plan focuses on addressing one of the biggest global market failures: the fact that 700 million people still lack access to electricity, despite the world having had electricity for nearly 150 years. The lack of access to electricity means reliance on harmful, expensive, and dangerous fuels, especially in vulnerable communities.

The solution involves two key approaches:
1. **Rethinking Risk**: Challenging the conventional approach to risk, especially in the context of the financial and developmental sectors.
2. **Bridging the Gap Between Mitigation and Adaptation**: Tackling both reducing emissions (mitigation) and adapting to climate crises simultaneously.

The **stakes** are high: electricity is not just about lighting; it provides resilience, empowers people, aids communication, enables irrigation, and supports cooling, especially in times of climate disasters. It represents basic human dignity and is fundamental for education, healthcare, businesses, and building resilience in a volatile climate.

While solar energy has made impressive progress, with off-grid solar systems impacting millions of lives, there are still significant gaps. Vulnerable regions like Burundi, Malawi, and Chad are lagging behind in electrification.

**The Impact of Solar Energy**:
- Off-grid solar systems have already helped reduce the number of people without electricity by half since 2007.
- Solar energy empowers people by providing light and reducing costs.
- This sector has created 370,000+ jobs and could help reach another 300 million people by the end of the decade.
- Providing solar to 10 million families could reduce carbon emissions by 27 million tons and generate $10 billion in direct economic benefits.

**Challenges and Solutions**:
- Despite the growing need for capital, there is a gap in investment. While $2 trillion was allocated globally for transitioning from fossil fuels, less than 0.1% went to off-grid solar.
- A multi-layered capital approach, involving philanthropy, impact investing, and commercial bank support, is being used to raise funds for the most challenging energy markets in Africa.
- Partnerships across the investment spectrum are essential to creating a sustainable model for energy access.

**Moral Imagination**:
- Addressing energy access is not just an economic or financial challenge but a moral one. The decision to invest in off-grid energy is one that can unlock human potential and dignity.
- The risks of inaction are immense: leaving millions without energy, worsening emissions, and contributing to global instability. 

**The Future**:
- There is a long-term investment opportunity in emerging energy markets. By providing electricity, new markets, innovations, and services will be created, empowering millions.
- Looking back in 100 years, the hope is that future generations will recognize that we had the moral courage to bring electricity to everyone, uplifting humanity in the process.

**Key Takeaway**: Access to electricity is a fundamental human right that can drive resilience, empower communities, and mitigate climate change. It is a moral and financial imperative that requires rethinking traditional investment approaches and overcoming risk aversion.

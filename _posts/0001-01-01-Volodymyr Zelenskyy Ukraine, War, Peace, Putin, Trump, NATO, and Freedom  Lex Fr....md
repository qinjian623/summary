The podcast features a conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy about various pressing topics related to the war in Ukraine, his diplomatic efforts, and his perspectives on world politics. Below is a summary of the main points discussed:

1. **War and Peace Efforts**: Zelenskyy talks about the challenges of securing peace amid the ongoing conflict, emphasizing that Ukraine has not profited from the war, despite accusations of corruption. He highlights the Ukrainian government’s efforts to crack down on corruption, particularly in weaponry supply chains. He also mentions disinformation as a significant issue, noting how Russia has spread lies to undermine trust in Ukraine.

2. **Talks with Putin**: Zelenskyy denies that Ukraine is unwilling to talk to Russian President Vladimir Putin, but he insists that peace talks are only possible under the right circumstances. He explains that Putin's actions, including the invasion of Ukraine and support for disinformation, undermine trust and complicate negotiations.

3. **Corruption and Military Aid**: He reassures figures like Donald Trump and Elon Musk that Ukraine is serious about fighting corruption. Zelenskyy stresses that the weapons provided to Ukraine are used responsibly, with strict oversight to prevent any misuse. He also outlines how Ukraine has faced significant challenges in terms of receiving the necessary military support at the onset of the war.

4. **Personal Reflections on War**: Zelenskyy reflects on the personal toll of war, describing how his life and responsibilities have been drastically altered since the invasion began. He speaks emotionally about the loss of loved ones and the profound impact the war has had on families, including his own.

5. **Language and Identity**: A significant portion of the conversation revolves around language, with Zelenskyy discussing the importance of Ukrainian over Russian. Despite being fluent in Russian, Zelenskyy insists on speaking Ukrainian in the context of the war as a symbol of resistance and sovereignty. He touches on the sensitive topic of language use in Ukraine, acknowledging the complex history between the two countries.

6. **International Support and NATO**: Zelenskyy makes a case for stronger international support for Ukraine, particularly in the form of NATO membership and continued weapons supply. He emphasizes that security guarantees for Ukraine must be robust and that a ceasefire must be accompanied by measures to ensure Russia cannot resume its aggression in the future. He also expresses trust in U.S. President Donald Trump, believing that Trump could play a crucial role in negotiating peace, but only if Ukraine is in a strong position.

7. **Historical Context and the Budapest Memorandum**: Zelenskyy reflects on Ukraine's historical struggles for sovereignty, referencing the Budapest Memorandum, where nuclear powers promised to respect Ukraine’s borders in exchange for giving up its nuclear weapons. He criticizes the failure of those security guarantees, particularly the lack of action from the signatories when Russia annexed Crimea and launched the war in 2022.

8. **The Future of Russian-Ukrainian Relations**: Zelenskyy discusses the long-term possibility of reconciliation between the Russian and Ukrainian peoples. He draws comparisons to post-World War II Germany, where the nation acknowledged its past and moved toward reconciliation with its neighbors. He suggests that Russia, too, will eventually have to face its historical guilt and seek to make amends.

9. **The Role of Leadership and Peace**: The conversation ends on a hopeful note, with Zelenskyy expressing his belief that peace is possible, but only through strong leadership and international cooperation. He advocates for a strong Ukraine as a foundation for peace, with security guarantees, arms support, and diplomatic negotiations leading the way. He envisions a future where, with the right conditions, Ukraine, Russia, and the world can find a path to peace.

This conversation touches on the emotional, political, and military aspects of the ongoing war in Ukraine, as well as Zelenskyy’s leadership and vision for the country’s future.

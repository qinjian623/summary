The podcast episode with historian Serhii Plokhy delves deeply into the complexities surrounding the history of Ukraine, Russia, the Soviet Union, and their intertwined destinies, particularly through the lens of the Soviet collapse and the ongoing conflict.

### **Key Highlights:**

#### 1. **Collapse of the Soviet Union**
   Plokhy argues that the fall of the Soviet Union was not simply the result of ideological collapse, but a combination of economic breakdown, ideological failure, and the mobilization of local nationalisms. The collapse of the Soviet Union was part of a broader disintegration of empires, and Ukraine played a pivotal role. The region's independence in 1991 effectively marked the end of the Soviet empire. He believes that the Soviet Union’s collapse was more a product of internal dynamics and external pressures than the direct influence of the United States or the Cold War.

#### 2. **Rise of Nationalism and Russian Imperialism**
   The discussion touches on the continuity of Russian imperialism, which started with the Russian Empire and continued through the Soviet Union. After the Soviet Union's dissolution, Russia sought to reclaim its imperial status. Russian nationalism, alongside local nationalism in regions like Ukraine and Georgia, became a destructive force in maintaining a multi-ethnic state. This dynamic persists today, particularly with the Russian state's attitude toward Ukraine's independence.

#### 3. **Ukraine's Role in 1991**
   The Ukrainian referendum of 1991, where Ukrainians overwhelmingly voted for independence, was a decisive moment. It led to the end of the Soviet Union, as Russia no longer saw value in preserving the union without Ukraine, the second-largest republic. The economic and geopolitical consequences of this loss continue to shape Russian policy toward Ukraine today.

#### 4. **Putin's Views on Soviet Collapse**
   Putin's belief that the collapse of the Soviet Union was the "greatest tragedy" of the 20th century reflects his view of the Soviet Empire as a major force for stability and progress in the region. Plokhy contextualizes this as part of Putin’s broader desire to restore Russia’s imperial past, and argues that Putin's motivations for invading Ukraine in 2022 are rooted in this longing for empire, rather than concerns about NATO expansion.

#### 5. **Russian and Ukrainian National Identities**
   The shared history and cultural ties between Russia and Ukraine complicate the conflict. Plokhy emphasizes the deep cultural similarities between the two nations but also highlights how Ukraine’s history is defined by its resistance to Russian control. The formation of Ukrainian nationalism, both radical and communist, dates back to the 20th century and has always sought to resist imperial dominance, especially Russian. This struggle for national identity became more pronounced in the wake of the Soviet collapse.

#### 6. **The Role of NATO and Western Influence**
   NATO's involvement, particularly in the 2008 Bucharest Summit, is seen as a crucial moment in shaping Russian-Ukrainian relations. Russia's fears of NATO expansion were a contributing factor to the invasion, although Plokhy suggests that NATO’s presence was more of an excuse than the root cause. Russia’s true concern has always been Ukraine’s move away from Russian influence and toward the West, which threatened its sphere of influence.

#### 7. **The Legacy of World War II and the Bandera Myth**
   A key discussion point is the mythologization of Ukrainian figures like Stepan Bandera, who fought for Ukraine's independence during World War II. Bandera's controversial collaboration with Nazi Germany has been a point of contention, with Russia using it to label Ukraine as a haven for neo-Nazis. Plokhy explains that while Bandera’s legacy is highly complex, his name has been politicized in contemporary debates about Ukrainian nationalism and identity.

#### 8. **Vladimir Putin and the KGB Legacy**
   Plokhy traces Putin’s rise from his KGB background, noting how the KGB shaped his worldview and approach to governance. The KGB, with its vast power and reach, provided Putin with the tools to consolidate control, and its methods continue to influence Russia’s foreign and domestic policies.

#### 9. **Ukrainian Nationalism and the Future of Ukraine**
   The podcast also touches on how Ukraine has navigated its own identity through its history, from the 17th and 18th centuries to the modern day. With the ongoing war, Ukraine’s internal divisions have diminished, and a renewed sense of national unity has emerged, particularly under President Zelensky, whose leadership has helped to unify the country in the face of Russian aggression.

#### 10. **The Current Conflict and Geopolitical Implications**
   The podcast concludes by reflecting on the broader implications of the war in Ukraine. Plokhy suggests that the conflict is part of a long-running struggle for self-determination and empire, and the current Russian aggression represents the continuation of the Russian Empire’s expansionist ambitions. The war has significant geopolitical ramifications, with global powers like the US, NATO, and Russia playing pivotal roles in shaping the future of Ukraine.

### **Summary in Chinese (简短总结):**
普洛霍（Plokhy）在节目中深入探讨了苏联解体及其对乌克兰、俄罗斯及更广泛地区的历史影响。他认为苏联的解体并非单纯的意识形态崩溃，而是多种因素的结合，尤其是乌克兰在1991年独立的决定。普洛霍指出，俄罗斯的民族主义和帝国主义情结在今日的俄乌战争中仍然占据主导地位，而乌克兰的独立意识和反抗历史则深刻塑造了其民族身份。普洛霍分析了普京的历史观、俄罗斯的帝国主义动机以及西方在这一过程中的角色，特别是NATO的影响。

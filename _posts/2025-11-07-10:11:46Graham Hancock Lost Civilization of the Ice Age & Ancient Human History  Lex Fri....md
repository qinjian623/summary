This podcast features Graham Hancock, a journalist and author, discussing his theories on ancient civilizations, specifically focusing on the possibility of a lost advanced civilization during the Ice Age. Hancock, a proponent of controversial ideas about human history, explores the puzzle of why advanced civilizations only began to emerge around 10,000 years ago, after a cataclysmic event, the Younger Dryas, which he believes may have been caused by cosmic impacts. He suggests that the mainstream view of gradual human evolution and civilization is incomplete and that there may have been an earlier, more advanced civilization destroyed by this event.

Hancock questions why modern humans, who appeared around 300,000 years ago, took so long to develop civilization. He posits that the cataclysmic Younger Dryas event around 12,000 years ago might explain the sudden emergence of civilizations like Sumer, Egypt, and the Indus Valley. He also refers to significant archaeological sites like Göbekli Tepe in Turkey, which he believes could be a remnant of a lost civilization, possibly linked to this global catastrophe. Hancock draws parallels between similar myths, spiritual ideas, and astronomical knowledge across distant ancient cultures, suggesting that they might share a common source.

In addition to discussing the lost civilization theory, Hancock touches on the history of exploration, the use of astronomical symbolism in ancient cultures, and the global spread of knowledge. He highlights how ancient maps and astronomical alignments support the idea of advanced knowledge being passed down through time, despite the absence of physical evidence for a fully developed civilization from the Ice Age.

He concludes by emphasizing the importance of examining myths and archaeological gaps to fully understand humanity's past, suggesting that the real story of our history may still be hidden in unstudied parts of the world, such as the Sahara, the Amazon, and submerged coastal areas.

这期播客邀请了记者和作家格雷厄姆·汉考克（Graham Hancock），他讨论了自己对古代文明的理论，尤其是关于冰河时代失落的先进文明的可能性。汉考克是一位主张有争议的古代历史观念的作者，他探讨了为什么先进文明直到约1万年前才开始出现，原因可能与一次灾难性事件——“年轻干旱”事件有关。他认为，这一事件可能是由宇宙碰撞引发的。他提出，主流观点关于人类逐步进化并发展文明的叙述是不完整的，或许曾有一场更先进的文明在这一事件中被摧毁。

汉考克质疑为什么现代人类（约30万年前出现）花费如此长时间才发展出文明。他认为，大约12000年前发生的“年轻干旱”事件可能解释了文明的突然出现，比如苏美尔、埃及和印度河流域文明。他还提到了像土耳其的Göbekli Tepe这样的考古遗址，他认为它可能是失落文明的遗迹，可能与全球灾难有关。汉考克认为，不同古代文化中相似的神话、精神观念和天文学知识，可能源自同一个早期文明。

除了讨论失落文明的理论外，汉考克还谈到了人类探索历史、古代文化中的天文学象征意义以及知识的全球传播。他强调，古代地图和天文对齐现象支持了这样一个观点，即早期的先进知识通过时间传播下来，尽管冰河时代的文明并未留下充分的物质证据。

他最后强调，要全面理解人类的历史，必须仔细审视神话和考古学中的空白，认为我们的历史故事可能依然隐藏在未被深入研究的世界角落，如撒哈拉沙漠、亚马逊雨林和沉没的沿海地区。
